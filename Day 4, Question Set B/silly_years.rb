# Prompt

# Write a function that takes a year (four digit integer) and returns an array
# with the 10 closest subsequent years that meet the following condition: the
# first two digits summed with the last two digits are equal to the middle two
# digits. E.g.,

# 1978 => 19 + 78 = 97
# 2307 => 23 + 07 = 30

def silly_years(year)
  middle_target = year % 10 - 1000 * year % 1000
  p middle_target
