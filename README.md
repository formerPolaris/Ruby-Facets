Ruby-Facets
===========

This repository contains two types of content: 1) My original solutions (where
possible) to common whiteboarding and algorithm-related programming problems as
put by App Academy, and 2) miscellaneous minor programs I put together while
attending the program.

Included in each of my solutions are notes detailing the way they work and how
(if appropriate) they differ from the approach taken in the provided solution.
All problems were worked, or attempted, prior to viewing the provided solutions.

My solutions also typically include program tests to demonstrate that they work.
